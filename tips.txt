configure: error: Package requirements (python-3.5) were not met:

No package 'python-3.5' found

Consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if you
installed software in a non-standard prefix.

Alternatively, you may set the environment variables PYTHON_CFLAGS
and PYTHON_LIBS to avoid the need to call pkg-config.
See the pkg-config man page for more details.
